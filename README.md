# 🛡️ Cute Knight

**Cute Knight** is a simple 2D platformer made using the **Godot Engine**, based on [Brackeys' 2D Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&ab_channel=Brackeys). In this chibi-style game, a tiny knight collects coins and avoids creepy slimes — built as my first published game project!
